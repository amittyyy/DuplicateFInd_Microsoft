Given a comma-separated file containing a column header in its first line, write a method that will output all lines in the file that contain duplicate values in a specified column.
This should be written in C# as a command line application (no gui), support for quoting and other advanced features of CSV format not required.
Implementation details and program interface is up to you to decide.
 
Examples:
TestFile.csv
column1,column2
1,a
1,c
2,d
3,d
1,b
4,e
4,d
 
Program run with parameters "TestFile.csv" and "column1" should find '1' and '4' occurring more than once in column1 and produce the output:
1,a
1,c
1,b
4,e
4,d
 
Program run with parameters "TestFile.csv" and "column2" finds "d" as a duplicate entry:
2,d
3,d
4,d
